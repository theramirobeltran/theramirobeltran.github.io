I know in reality that this project has a near 100% chance of going nowhere, only to die a slow \n  death in github or gitlab. I'm sorry code, this was not the life I intended for you.\n\n  There is, however, a super-slim chance that this is something I will work on for the next couple of months or years, and an even \n  slimmer chance of ever becoming publicly available. Knowing that, I still choose to take the time up front to think about things that \n  include:\n\n  Structure, Language, Dependencies, Modularity, Environments, etc,.\n\n  The arguments against this approach may include:\n  - Waste of time for inconsequential work\n  - Solving too far into the future\n  - And other things.\n\n  **Spaghetti code**. We've all seen it, worked on it, and contributed to it.\n\n  This is what we get when we fail to plan or plan poorly. I've seen it my code, in startups, and elsewhere. I mention startups \n  only because there is often a desire to move extremely quickly at all costs, sometimes sacrificing maintainability and scalability. \n  I understand that startups are often backed by VCs and may feel pressure to continuously deliver value to their customers, but there \n  should still be a balance between feature delivery and building a solid foundation.\n\n  Please know that I am not bashing these companies, because a company that has funding or making money is 1000 times better than a company \n  going broke, or one that never got off the ground to begin with. I am looking at this simply as a technologist who loves clean, maintainable, \n  and scalable code. But a personal project can quickly become more than that. And, if it does, it will be too late to think about structure. \n  I say it will be too late, because it's incredibly difficult to convince others(and yourself) of the value you gain from a light refactor or \n  rebuild, and the longer this goes on, the more expensive it becomes in terms of time and money.\n\n  So, when building your personal project, take some time up front to work up a technical design. Some of the benefits will be:\n  - Your understanding of the problem will become more clear\n  - Your understanding of system design will grow\n  - You will stumble upon other approaches to solving your problem\n  - You may find solutions to leverage as opposed to building everything yourself\n  - It will be a stronger project in your portfolio for potential employers\n\n  These are just some of the benefits of technical or system design in a personal project.\n\n  When I first started writing code, I was building iOS apps in Swift.\n\n  **There was no forethought. No design. No path.**\n\n  I was simply solving the problem in front of me, adding more noodles to the bowl of already overflowing spaghetti. I shouldn't brag about \n  this, but I got pretty good at reinventing the wheel.\n\n  Don't worry if you don't know the correct way to design a project/system. Think through the problem you are looking to solve, and \n  write up a simple list of requirements in notepad. Refine and prioritize those requirements once or twice. Done.\n\n  Remember, some technical design is better than none.\n  "}},45:function(e,t,n){e.exports=n(78)},53:function(e,t,n){},54:function(e,t,n){},55:function(e,t,n){},56:function(e,t,n){e.exports=n.p+"static/media/profile_pic.7789b5d6.jpg"},61:function(e,t,n){},62:function(e,t,n){},71:function(e,t,n){var o={"./":17,"./bio.md":72,"./burnout.md":73,"./conferences.md":74,"./index":17,"./index.js":17,"./journey.md":75,"./technicalDesign.md":76,"./tecnicalDesign":36,"./tecnicalDesign.js":36};function i(e){var t=a(e);return n(t)}function a(e){if(!n.o(o,e)){var t=new Error("Cannot find module '"+e+"'");throw t.code="MODULE_NOT_FOUND",t}return o[e]}i.keys=function(){return Object.keys(o)},i.resolve=a,e.exports=i,i.id=71},72:function(e,t,n){e.exports=n.p+"static/media/bio.d1d4b4bd.md"},73:function(e,t,n){e.exports=n.p+"static/media/burnout.cfcadf5e.md"},74:function(e,t,n){e.exports=n.p+"static/media/conferences.98c3be0a.md"},75:function(e,t,n){e.exports=n.p+"static/media/journey.fcf79dfb.md"},76:function(e,t,n){e.exports=n.p+"static/media/technicalDesign.a392c289.md"},77:function(e,t,n){},78:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t);var o=n(2),i=n.n(o),a=n(37),r=n.n(a),s=(n(53),n(54),n(90)),l=n(26),c=(n(55),function(e){var t=e.phrase;return i.a.createElement("header",null,i.a.createElement("section",{id:"intro"},i.a.createElement("img",{src:n(56),alt:"ramiro beltran"}),i.a.createElement("h1",null,"Ramiro 'Ram' Beltran"),i.a.createElement(s.a,{children:t,remarkPlugins:[l.a],className:"phrase"})))}),u=(n(61),function(){return i.a.createElement("div",{className:"contact-card"},i.a.createElement("p",null,"Connect with me on"),i.a.createElement("a",{href:"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramirobeltran"},"LinkedIn"))}),h=(n(62),function(e){var t=e.article;return i.a.createElement("article",null,i.a.createElement(s.a,{children:t,remarkPlugins:[l.a]}))}),m=n(42),d=(n(70),n(5)),p=n(13),f=n(17),g=["I dabble in code; Sometimes it works.","Solving problems; 1 `if` statement at a time.","For the \u2764\ufe0f of code.","I can print `Hello World` in at least 4 languages \ud83d\ude1c","At best a 4~~p~~x developer"],b=function(){var e=Object(o.useState)(0),t=Object(p.a)(e,2),i=t[0],a=t[1],r=Object(o.useState)(f.default[i]),s=Object(p.a)(r,2),l=s[0],c=s[1];return Object(o.useEffect)((function(){var e=f.default[i];(function(e){var t=n(71)("./".concat(e));return fetch(t).then((function(e){return e.text()})).then((function(e){return e}))})(e.fileName).then((function(t){c(Object(d.a)(Object(d.a)({},e),{},{body:t}))}))}),[i]),{article:l,articles:f.default,setArticleIdx:a}};var w=function(){var e,t,n=Object(o.useState)(g[(e=0,t=g.length,e=Math.ceil(e),t=Math.floor(t),Math.floor(Math.random()*(t-e)+e))]);return Object(p.a)(n,1)[0]};n(77);var y=function(e){var t=e.data,n=e.onChange,a=e.showThumbs,r=function(){var e=Object(o.useState)({width:void 0,height:void 0}),t=Object(p.a)(e,2),n=t[0],i=t[1];return Object(o.useEffect)((function(){function e(){i({width:window.innerWidth,height:window.innerHeight})}return window.addEventListener("resize",e),e(),function(){return window.removeEventListener("resize",e)}}),[]),n}().width;return i.a.createElement(m.Carousel,{showThumbs:a,onChange:n,data:t,showIndicators:t.length>1,showStatus:t.length>1},t.map((function(e){return i.a.createElement("div",{key:e.title,style:{width:"100%",maxHeight:"300px",display:"flex",justifyContent:"center"}},i.a.createElement("img",{className:"centered",alt:e.description,src:e.image,style:{objectFit:"cover",maxHeight:r<400?"200px":"inherit"}}))})))},v=function(){var e=b(),t=e.article,n=e.articles,o=e.setArticleIdx,a=w();return i.a.createElement(i.a.Fragment,null,i.a.createElement(c,{phrase:a}),i.a.createElement("main",null,i.a.createElement(y,{data:n,onChange:o,showThumbs:!1}),i.a.createElement("p",{style:{opacity:.5,marginTop:5,textAlign:"right"}},t.publishedDate),i.a.createElement(h,{article:t.body})),i.a.createElement(u,null))};Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));r.a.render(i.a.createElement(i.a.StrictMode,null,i.a.createElement(v,null)),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((function(e){e.unregister()})).catch((function(e){console.error(e.message)}))}},[[45,1,2]]]);
