It does not provide advanced notice. And, it tends to overstay its welcome.***\n\n  I should know, because it hit me hard unexpectedly not too long ago, and to this day cannot completely shake it. But what exactly are we \n  talking about here? Burnout to you may mean something completely different than what burnout means to me, but I do think there are \n  some similarities in terms of what it feels like for different people. To me, it feels like a lack of joy in the things that used to \n  bring me joy. It means dreading the next workday, and slogging through the week. It means taking way longer to complete tasks than is really \n  necessary not because you can't figure them out, but because you have lost the desire to or because the overhead to complete work feels heavy. \n  It can even feel like or lead to depression, which is a terrible feeling. My burnout was related to my work, \ud83d\udcaf. Tech has been a huge part of my \n  life for quite some time now, and I have no desire in leaving it, but changes had to be made in order for me to enjoy it again. I can't pinpoint \n  when it set in exactly, but in hindsight know that I was trying to do too much.  \n\n  ## Hindsight\n  They say that hindsight is 20/20. And, when I say *they*, I'm talking about all the people who have ever said it in the history of everything \ud83d\ude09.\n  In agile, we have these ceremonies, with one being a retrospective. This takes place at the end of a sprint, and gives the team an opportunity \n  to discuss the things that went well or not so well during the recently completed sprint. You may also come away with action items(adjustments). If \n  I had to do a retro on the things that didn't go so well in the time leading up to what I felt was burnout, I could definitely identify some things \n  that in hindsight may(most likely) have contributed to it. During this time, I was working full-time as a software developer, doing hackathons, and \n  putting in lots of hours afterwork and on the weekends building personal projects while also trying to give my family the time they needed and deserved. \n  I was as *they* say, \"burning the candle at both ends\". I also thought about all the time I was spending in front of a screen, and how little to none I \n  was spending on my physical fitness, or getting outdoors to bathe in the sun when it wasn't 100+ degrees outside.\n  \n  ## Fighting Back\n  Just because burnout hits hard, doesn't mean that its a one-sided fight. Nor does it mean that you have to fight it alone. Talk about it with others,\n  and you may just realize that you aren't alone, or the first. Learn how others got back to good, and take the things that appeal to you. We all have \n  to work to provide for ourselves or our families, but it doesn't mean that work has to suck or be unbearable. Find ways to make work fun! Or find other \n  work that is. If at the end of the day, you cannot find work that is interesting and enjoyable to you, create it. \n\n  ## Prevention\n  The best case scenario is preventing burnout before it takes hold. But, is prevention even possible? I have to believe that there are \n  some things we can do to help reduce the possibilities here, and in some circumstances prevent it altogether. In my case, I could have prioritized \n  things a little better. My mental health should have been higher on the list than all the problems I wanted to solve and all the things I wanted to \n  build. I should have stepped away from my computer and desk more. I should have declined meetings that weren't really necessary in favor of \n  asynchronous communication like slack and email. I should have planned more out of the office(house) lunches. Most important of all, I should have \n  spent the time up front prioritizing my days, and weeks around me. It sounds selfish, but in this case, I think its necessary. \n\n  ## My Advice to You\n  Beware that nobody is immune to burnout, even you. Acknowledge that it is a real thing with real effects. Some of those effects are The Great Resignation\n  and/or The Great Reshuffle. Be proactive and talk about it with others including your boss. Openly identify and discuss the things leading you to feel \n  burnt out, and then take action. Take random and unplanned days off to recharge regularly. And, if you don't work at a place that allows you to do just \n  that even in the current work environment, try to find one that does. I was fortunate enough to have been able to attend [RenderATL](https://www.renderatl.com/) \n  recently and more specifically see a talk given by [@chantastic](https://twitter.com/chantastic?s=20&t=6kakIWTomFfE_YlrW5q8cQ) about a line. It touches\n  on this very topic. If you ever get a chance to watch it, you will not regret it.\n  \n  Someone somewhere(\ud83d\ude09) said that, \"if you find the work you love, you will never work another day in your life\". I just want to love my work, \n  and hope that you can too. \n    "},{image:"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1537979/pexels-photo-1537979.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1",description:"A short history of my journey with the tech industry",title:"Journey into Tech",publishedDate:"April 27, 2022",article:" \n  ## My Journey in Tech\n  I like to say that \"I dabble in code, and sometimes it works\". Its in an effort to keep myself grounded, \n  to not be confined or defined by my job title, and because its true. I don't write perfect code, or engineer \n  a solution perfectly on the first pass. I enjoy solving problems and just so happen to use code as the primary \n  medium for doing so. I have been dabbling in code since 2011. I was attending my community college, taking courses that \n  would hopefully go towards a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering. Spoiler Alert: that never happened. I was a \n  mechanical engineering major because I had wanted to solve big problems with big impact. This was before I ever considered \n  talking to computers as a career. That changed when I took an intro to programming course, and ended up hooked on code. Today \n  I am a software engineer / developer / coder / key-pusher or any other name that describes what I do. Depending on the context \n  or mood, I will either use the term developer or engineer throughout this post. Just know that this is not the place where I debate \n  that terminology. It is also worth noting that I am at best a 4x developer, and thats perfectly fine with me. But, long before I wrote \n  my first line of what I consider meaninful code, I wrote some basic unix commands and shell scripts(ok, this may be considered code too) \n  many, many years before.\n    \n  ## 1998 and 1999\n  My first real exposure to technology(and yes, I am aware that's a term spanning many areas) was in high school in 1998. \n  Its sad(for me, not for you) that some of you reading this were not even alive then. Oh how the time has passed. My school \n  wasn't a wealthy school by any means, but I am very thankful to have had a teacher that taught technology related topics \n  from AC/DC electronics to A+ and Network+ certifications. He was a retired Air Force Colonel(or Lt. Colonel) that if I remember\n   correctly, and was an engineer of some sort when he served. I know his first name was Dan, but for the life of me cannot \n   remember his last name. Oh, if there was only a way to find that out ;). I ended up taking a couple of the courses that Colonel \n   Dan taught, and because I was able to pick it up so quickly, I was given the opportunity to participate in a school work program \n   over the summers of 1998 and 1999 along with 1 other student where we would visit schools in the district performing software \n   installs, system upgrades(hardware and software), networking, and some light troubleshooting. This is where I first learned how to \n   create jumper cables(ethernet) and format hard drives. Until recently, I used to discredit this as not relevant to software engineering,\n    but no longer do so because I have in so many ways leaned on those experiences when solving problems. I was discounting my experiences \n    and abilities, making it easier for potential employers to pay me less or to mark down my skills. Because on paper, it looks like I \n    just started doing this in 2017. Thats a huge difference right. I had to bust out a calculator just to do the math. In fairness, its \n    not like I worked in a tech space from that time onward. You see, I love solving problems, but find it difficult to solve the same problem \n    over and over again. So, as I entered my senior year, I was ready for a new challenge, and decided to join the Army.\n    \n  ## 2000 - 2009\n  This section will be brief. I served in the Army from the summer of 2000 to the summer of 2004. After exiting the military, I returned \n  to my hometown, met my wife, and went on to work jobs as porter at a dealership, cable splicer at a contracting company, and field technician \n  at a local cable company. In what seems like the blink of an eye, nine years came and went.\n      \n  ## College\n  My wife is a nurse today, but she didn't always want to be one. Turns out that she had attended college before I met her, and was \n  on an extended break from what was going to be a pyschology degree. This break lasted many years, and I'm sure longer than she had \n  anticipated. Finally, in 2009, we both decided to go back to school together. We needed to make a change, and were looking for careers, \n  not jobs. I chose mechanical engineering, and she chose nursing. Interestingly enough, and as if he was seeking the perfect timing to make \n  his grand entrance, my son decided to show up at the end of 2009. My wife did not have the ideal pregnancy, with our first or second child, \n  and this made attending college really difficult. Nonetheless, she was able to complete her nursing degree on time, and quickly went to work. \n  At the beginning of this section I said that we both went back to school together. That's 100% true. We did not however, continue together. \n  When my son was born, I went back to work full-time to help support our family, and have struggled to this day to finish what I started. It does not \n  mean that I quit school completely, but that I attended on and off for about 9 years. That's a long time, I know. I should be a doctor by now. \n  Somewhere in there, before taking a break, I took that intro to programming course in C++  as I mentioned earlier that changed everything, including \n  my major.\n      \n  ## Building Apps\n  I am a firm believer in the idea that if you aren't happy with the way things are, you change them. Even though school was ultimately put \n  on hold for me, it didn't mean that I couldn't continue to learn and progress on my own. Sometime in 2014, I got into building iOS apps. I \n  thought about what tech I had available to me, and what I found really interesting. We had my wife's macbook pro she purchased for nursing \n  school, and no longer needed. I had an early version ipad, and an iphone. The decision was simple. I'll build mobile apps for the iOS platform. \n  Another motivating factor were all the Udemy and YouTube tutorials in Swift, which at the time was still fairly new. I think it was version 2 \n  when I started working with it, but was very human-readable and appealing. If I had to start with Objective C, it might not had gone so well. \n  Over about 3 years I built and published 4 apps to the AppStore that I was really proud of. Correction, I am still really proud of them. These \n  were fairly original ideas and included custom(and cringy) artwork. I found that I learned more quickly and thoroughly when I had to solve \n  problems that I was interested in solving, and had not already been solved for me. Theres nothing wrong with follow-along tutorials, but I \n  recommend to anyone interested in gaining deep understanding of something to solve problems interesting to them, regardless of the discipline.\n      \n  ## First Paying Opportunity\n  I had known about USAA for a long time. In fact, I had been a member since joining the military in 2000. I regarded them as a company with \n  high moral standards, and one that treated their members well, myself included. In early 2016, I found out about a program they were running \n  called VetFit. It provided veterans the opportunity to go through a tech bootcamp of sorts, while getting paid intern-level compensation, and \n  having a position as an entry-level software developer when it was successfully completed. I applied, made it through some rounds, but was \n  ultimately not chosen for the cohort. It hurt. A lot. At this point, I thought I was the perfect fit, having built 4 amazing(not so much) apps, \n  and having interviewed so well, and whatever else. What did I do wrong? Well, I had no choice but to pick myself up. Had I let that be the end \n  of my journey, I would not be here talking about it. I continued to maintain my apps, and started learning more about frontend development. I \n  was and continue to be passionate about great user experiences whether mobile or on the web. When the next cohort was being filled, I was very \n  hesitant to apply because I did not want to be rejected again. I am so glad that I ignored those feelings, and did apply, because it became my \n  first paying job in software. Something that I forgot to mention, so I'll just drop it here. I had applied to many entry-level iOS developer jobs \n  before landing the one at USAA, but I got nothing in terms of traction. It was like sending applications into a black hole. Stuff goes in, but \n  nothing comes out. If you are in a similar position, remember, the first one is always the hardest to land. After that, it only gets better.\n      \n  ## Present Day\n  Today I work at a startup(sort of) as a Senior Frontend Engineer. The role before this one was also at a startup. Whether you work at a startup or \n  enterprise, or somewhere in between, know what you bring to the table. Be confident, but tactful when discussing your experience and skills and how \n  they can help this or the next company. Don't be so quick to discount your experiences just because they may not feel relevant. Do an inventory of \n  what you've accomplished thus far. I used to think that you and only you were your own advocate and cheerleader. I was wrong. Surround yourself with \n  people that cheer for you and hype you up because they know that the team is better off with you on it, than without.\n      \n  Everything else, well, thats another story for another day."},{image:"https://images.pexels.com/photos/6230973/pexels-photo-6230973.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1",description:"description",title:"About Me",publishedDate:"August 2020",article:"\n  ## A little about me\n  I am a professional Software Developer working in an Enterprise\n  environment, and have been for the last 4 years. It is very\n  different than when you are say, going to school, learning to code,\n  and/or being an indie developer. It means getting paid to do what you\n  love. It means continuing to educate yourself in the ever-evolving\n  world of code, latest technologies and trends not just because you\n  want to, but because you have to.\n\n  Before I worked for an enterprise, I considered myself an indie\n  developer, not really knowing what that meant either. I was doing some\n  web stuff, and building mobile apps, never earning anything worth\n  writing about. Really, anything that I wanted to work on, I built. I\n  could take my time, make all the decisions, and have complete creative\n  freedom. This is both a good and really bad thing. It means that your\n  project may get delayed or abandoned. It will most likely not take\n  into account various user types, and fail to test for all scenarios.\n  It means that you are accountable to no-one but yourself.\n\n  Even though I really enjoy personal projects, working in an enterprise\n  has taught me to be a stronger developer, to hold myself accountable,\n  and to produce quality code.\n\n  ## What I love about Software\n  To begin, it is everywhere. And it's not going anywhere.  \n\n  Think about it, cars have computers running code in them that control\n  everything from fuel injection to the brakes and more, medical devices\n  that monitor your vitals run on code, and cash registers are\n  practically all iPads now. I cant even remember the last time I\n  carried cash. Being both a good and bad thing, software exists in just\n  about everything these days. Setting aside all the negatives that come\n  with living in a society that is so totally dependent on code, and\n  there are many, I\u2019d like to list a couple of things I love about\n  software.\n\n  First, I like that it is a field with really low entrance\n  requirements. You can go from being a fast-food worker to an\n  entry-level developer in 6 months with the right attitude and work\n  ethic. It all (mostly) boils down to how much you are willing to put\n  in, which is mostly time. To become a Nurse or Doctor can be very\n  expensive and time-consuming. You have to attend classes in person for\n  years, and pass a grueling exam when you are done. Then, you have to\n  train under another medical professional for a time, and take\n  mandatory courses to maintain your license. When you are done, you\u2019ve\n  got this huge debt that you racked up over the years (unless you found\n  other ways), and need that good salary just to pay it back. To be\n  clear, developing is NOT for everyone, and should NOT be done just\n  because of the pay, but if you like solving problems, and you can\n  repurpose the time spent binging Netflix to learning to code, you can\n  be a Software Developer. Remember, there are more job openings than\n  there are developers to fill them.\n\n  Second, we are limited only by our imaginations when it comes to what\n  is possible in this space. If you wanted to build a game about pigs\n  that fly and eat clouds, all you would need is an environment like\n  Unity (free), and a little coding knowledge which can be learned\n  relatively quickly (also free). Sure you\u2019ll need a computer to work\n  on, but many people have them nowadays, or can get a used one for next\n  to nothing (they depreciate faster than cars). Just ask around. I saw\n  the movie Ready Player One by Steven Spielberg a couple of months ago,\n  and thought about how life often imitates art, and many inventions\n  come from ideas in film. I know that there are many companies out\n  there working really hard on Virtual Reality headsets and content, and\n  other things being worked in secret. It's just a matter of time before\n  we are all spending most of our time in the Oasis. Wouldn\u2019t be much\n  different than staring at our phones all day long.\n\n  ## Music to my code\n  I love music, and often code while listening to music. Sure I know\n  what you are thinking, \"Duh, Everyone loves music\". I mean that it\n  resonates with me because it is a form of creativity based firmly in\n  logic (music theory), and I love to make music. I am by nature,\n  creative, and if I am not able to express it, I go crazy. It's part of\n  what draws me to web development and software in general. You get to\n  draw something beautiful without having the skills with a pencil and\n  paper, or brush and canvas. You get to construct something out of\n  nothing.\n\n  I had played guitar for about 7 years, then lost interest in it and\n  stopped cold turkey. Life also got busy, as it happens to do. I sold 4\n  guitars, and kept only my acoustic, which I very rarely play. I didn\u2019t\n  lose interest in music or being creative, it was just the tool used to\n  create. Not too long ago, the music bug bit me again. I actually\n  purchased a piano in October of 2018 so that my son could learn to\n  play, knowing that it was something I had also wanted for myself.\n  Then, in December of the same year, after about 13 years without an\n  electric guitar, a Fender Telecaster called my name. And just this\n  morning (August 1, 2020), I picked up my acoustic, and it felt great.\n  Another thing I love about software is that there are so many\n  different tools involved, it's impossible to get bored. But if you do,\n  take some time, breathe, and build something just for fun."}],p=["I dabble in code; Sometimes it works.","Solving problems; 1 `if` statement at a time.","For the \u2764\ufe0f of code.","I can print `Hello World` in at least 4 languages \ud83d\ude1c","At best a 4~~p~~x developer"];var w=function(){var e,t,n=Object(o.useState)(0),i=Object(s.a)(n,2),r=i[0],h=i[1],l=Object(o.useState)(p[(e=0,t=p.length,e=Math.ceil(e),t=Math.floor(t),Math.floor(Math.random()*(t-e)+e))]),m=Object(s.a)(l,1)[0],w=y[r];return a.a.createElement(a.a.Fragment,null,a.a.createElement(d,{phrase:m}),a.a.createElement("main",null,a.a.createElement(g,{data:y,onChange:function(e){h(e)},showThumbs:!1}),a.a.createElement("p",{style:{opacity:.5,marginTop:5,textAlign:"right"}},w.publishedDate),a.a.createElement(c,{article:w.article})),a.a.createElement(u,null))};Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));r.a.render(a.a.createElement(a.a.StrictMode,null,a.a.createElement(w,null)),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((function(e){e.unregister()})).catch((function(e){console.error(e.message)}))}},[[43,1,2]]]);
