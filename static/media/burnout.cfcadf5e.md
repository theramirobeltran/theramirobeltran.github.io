# Burnout

**_It does not discriminate. It does not provide advanced notice. And, it tends to overstay its welcome._**

I should know, because it hit me hard unexpectedly not too long ago, and to this day cannot completely shake it. But what exactly are we
talking about here? Burnout to you may mean something completely different than what burnout means to me, but I do think there are
some similarities in terms of what it feels like for different people. To me, it feels like a lack of joy in the things that used to
bring me joy. It means dreading the next workday, and slogging through the week. It means taking way longer to complete tasks than is really
necessary not because you can't figure them out, but because you have lost the desire to or because the overhead to complete work feels heavy.
It can even feel like or lead to depression, which is a terrible feeling. My burnout was related to my work, ðŸ’¯. Tech has been a huge part of my
life for quite some time now, and I have no desire in leaving it, but changes had to be made in order for me to enjoy it again. I can't pinpoint
when it set in exactly, but in hindsight know that I was trying to do too much.

## Hindsight

They say that hindsight is 20/20. And, when I say _they_, I'm talking about all the people who have ever said it in the history of everything ðŸ˜‰.
In agile, we have these ceremonies, with one being a retrospective. This takes place at the end of a sprint, and gives the team an opportunity
to discuss the things that went well or not so well during the recently completed sprint. You may also come away with action items(adjustments). If
I had to do a retro on the things that didn't go so well in the time leading up to what I felt was burnout, I could definitely identify some things
that in hindsight may(most likely) have contributed to it. During this time, I was working full-time as a software developer, doing hackathons, and
putting in lots of hours afterwork and on the weekends building personal projects while also trying to give my family the time they needed and deserved.
I was as _they_ say, "burning the candle at both ends". I also thought about all the time I was spending in front of a screen, and how little to none I
was spending on my physical fitness, or getting outdoors to bathe in the sun when it wasn't 100+ degrees outside.

## Fighting Back

Just because burnout hits hard, doesn't mean that its a one-sided fight. Nor does it mean that you have to fight it alone. Talk about it with others,
and you may just realize that you aren't alone, or the first. Learn how others got back to good, and take the things that appeal to you. We all have
to work to provide for ourselves or our families, but it doesn't mean that work has to suck or be unbearable. Find ways to make work fun! Or find other
work that is. If at the end of the day, you cannot find work that is interesting and enjoyable to you, create it.

## Prevention

The best case scenario is preventing burnout before it takes hold. But, is prevention even possible? I have to believe that there are
some things we can do to help reduce the possibilities here, and in some circumstances prevent it altogether. In my case, I could have prioritized
things a little better. My mental health should have been higher on the list than all the problems I wanted to solve and all the things I wanted to
build. I should have stepped away from my computer and desk more. I should have declined meetings that weren't really necessary in favor of
asynchronous communication like slack and email. I should have planned more out of the office(house) lunches. Most important of all, I should have
spent the time up front prioritizing my days, and weeks around me. It sounds selfish, but in this case, I think its necessary.

## My Advice to You

Beware that nobody is immune to burnout, even you. Acknowledge that it is a real thing with real effects. Some of those effects are The Great Resignation
and/or The Great Reshuffle. Be proactive and talk about it with others including your boss. Openly identify and discuss the things leading you to feel
burnt out, and then take action. Take random and unplanned days off to recharge regularly. And, if you don't work at a place that allows you to do just
that even in the current work environment, try to find one that does. I was fortunate enough to have been able to attend [RenderATL](https://www.renderatl.com/)
recently and more specifically see a talk given by [@chantastic](https://twitter.com/chantastic?s=20&t=6kakIWTomFfE_YlrW5q8cQ) about a line. It touches
on this very topic. If you ever get a chance to watch it, you will not regret it.

Someone somewhere(ðŸ˜‰) said that, "if you find the work you love, you will never work another day in your life". I just want to love my work,
and hope that you can too.
