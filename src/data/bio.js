  ## A little about me
  I am a professional Software Developer working in an Enterprise
  environment, and have been for the last 4 years. It is very
  different than when you are say, going to school, learning to code,
  and/or being an indie developer. It means getting paid to do what you
  love. It means continuing to educate yourself in the ever-evolving
  world of code, latest technologies and trends not just because you
  want to, but because you have to.

  Before I worked for an enterprise, I considered myself an indie
  developer, not really knowing what that meant either. I was doing some
  web stuff, and building mobile apps, never earning anything worth
  writing about. Really, anything that I wanted to work on, I built. I
  could take my time, make all the decisions, and have complete creative
  freedom. This is both a good and really bad thing. It means that your
  project may get delayed or abandoned. It will most likely not take
  into account various user types, and fail to test for all scenarios.
  It means that you are accountable to no-one but yourself.

  Even though I really enjoy personal projects, working in an enterprise
  has taught me to be a stronger developer, to hold myself accountable,
  and to produce quality code.

  ## What I love about Software
  To begin, it is everywhere. And it's not going anywhere.  

  Think about it, cars have computers running code in them that control
  everything from fuel injection to the brakes and more, medical devices
  that monitor your vitals run on code, and cash registers are
  practically all iPads now. I cant even remember the last time I
  carried cash. Being both a good and bad thing, software exists in just
  about everything these days. Setting aside all the negatives that come
  with living in a society that is so totally dependent on code, and
  there are many, I’d like to list a couple of things I love about
  software.

  First, I like that it is a field with really low entrance
  requirements. You can go from being a fast-food worker to an
  entry-level developer in 6 months with the right attitude and work
  ethic. It all (mostly) boils down to how much you are willing to put
  in, which is mostly time. To become a Nurse or Doctor can be very
  expensive and time-consuming. You have to attend classes in person for
  years, and pass a grueling exam when you are done. Then, you have to
  train under another medical professional for a time, and take
  mandatory courses to maintain your license. When you are done, you’ve
  got this huge debt that you racked up over the years (unless you found
  other ways), and need that good salary just to pay it back. To be
  clear, developing is NOT for everyone, and should NOT be done just
  because of the pay, but if you like solving problems, and you can
  repurpose the time spent binging Netflix to learning to code, you can
  be a Software Developer. Remember, there are more job openings than
  there are developers to fill them.

  Second, we are limited only by our imaginations when it comes to what
  is possible in this space. If you wanted to build a game about pigs
  that fly and eat clouds, all you would need is an environment like
  Unity (free), and a little coding knowledge which can be learned
  relatively quickly (also free). Sure you’ll need a computer to work
  on, but many people have them nowadays, or can get a used one for next
  to nothing (they depreciate faster than cars). Just ask around. I saw
  the movie Ready Player One by Steven Spielberg a couple of months ago,
  and thought about how life often imitates art, and many inventions
  come from ideas in film. I know that there are many companies out
  there working really hard on Virtual Reality headsets and content, and
  other things being worked in secret. It's just a matter of time before
  we are all spending most of our time in the Oasis. Wouldn’t be much
  different than staring at our phones all day long.

  ## Music in the code
  I love music, and often code while listening to music. Sure I know
  what you are thinking, "Duh, Everyone loves music". I mean that it
  resonates with me because it is a form of creativity based firmly in
  logic (music theory), and I love to make music. I am by nature,
  creative, and if I am not able to express it, I go crazy. It's part of
  what draws me to web development and software in general. You get to
  draw something beautiful without having the skills with a pencil and
  paper, or brush and canvas. You get to construct something out of
  nothing.

  I had played guitar for about 7 years, then lost interest in it and
  stopped cold turkey. Life also got busy, as it happens to do. I sold 4
  guitars, and kept only my acoustic, which I very rarely play. I didn’t
  lose interest in music or being creative, it was just the tool used to
  create. Not too long ago, the music bug bit me again. I actually
  purchased a piano in October of 2018 so that my son could learn to
  play, knowing that it was something I had also wanted for myself.
  Then, in December of the same year, after about 13 years without an
  electric guitar, a Fender Telecaster called my name. And just this
  morning (August 1, 2020), I picked up my acoustic, and it felt great.
  Another thing I love about software is that there are so many
  different tools involved, it's impossible to get bored. But if you do,
  take some time, breathe, and build something just for fun.`,
