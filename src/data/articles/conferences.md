# Networking: Conferences

I had the privilege of attending [RenderATL](https://www.renderatl.com/) this past summer. This is my take on it, and conferences as a form of networking.

I don't know about you, but when I think of networking, the first thing that comes to my mind is LinkedIn. It is _the_ networking platform that I use daily, and the only one that I really pay any attention to. That's probably a miscalculation on my part, but I can relate to it and the people on the platform the most, and therefore, it is the one I gravitate towards.

Networking to me means:

> **Intentionally meeting people that I can learn something from, and hopefully give something back to in return.**

In the past, I've networked mostly with individuals looking to enter into tech, primarily focused on frontend development, because that is what I know. Well, that and other things software related. Today, I'm more intentional about networking with people outside of my comfort zone, including with those that are doing what I want to be doing, and those that have no relation to what that is.

LinkedIn and other social media platforms are not the only source of networking, nor should they be. We have mostly returned to in-person meetings and events, but lots of offices remain remote, and in turn networking with co-workers can suffer. To deal with this, some companies are doing on-site gatherings at either the office, or somewhere else chosen by leadership. These are great if you are working for a company that opts for this, and will foot the bill, but if you are in the process of making your way in, then this doesn't apply.

I started this post by saying that I was going to talk about my experience at RenderATL and tech conferences as a form of networking. You may be wondering how this can apply to you, if in fact you are an early-career developer, and you are not sure you can or want to spend the money to attend one.

It is true, conferences aren't cheap. Right now, on the Render site, tickets start at like $350 for students(must be able to prove), and $600 for early bird tickets for all others. That doesn't even include travel, hotel, and meals if you are coming from out of town. So, is it worth it?

In my opinion...

![exagerated yes](https://media0.giphy.com/media/h2TAvZ1ZSiPrKiP2TQ/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e477sfbwsla2yy3qojd5qtxxsa4h20ive3p8zhl13by&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g)

Yes, because of how much you take away. But before I get into that, I have to be clear that I did not have to pay for my experience, since the company I was working at sent the entire frontend team. This leads to the obvious next question: Would I have paid my own way if I had to? Again, yes!

## Biggest Takeaways from Render2022

### Speakers

Speakers may be the main reason for going to a conference, especially if you follow some of them on YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. Its not really any different than going to see a comedian or musical group on tour. Even though these talks will eventually be available online, I promise you its not the same. There were some really great speakers there, giving talks that appeal to everyone in 3 distinct tracks. I learned a lot about Web3, open-source, leadership, and other topics I wasn't even planning on seeing. I got to see these first hand, and talk with many of them immediately following their talks, and that's near impossible in any other setting. Online, you may or may not even get a reply via message, but even if you do, you don't get the same experience. Oh, and you will also get to see them and chat further at the many after-party type of events going on over the course of the conference as well as at the hotel. Tech, afterall, is a really warm group of folks from all backgrounds.

### Face2Face Networking

I connected with and met so many people I would never have otherwise. Many sponsoring companies have booths there, where you can ask questions in person that would be difficult to ask online. You get not only the response but the facial expressions that let you know how they really feel. For example, I talked to a recruiter at Microsoft, had a great chat, didn't feel rushed while just getting to know each other a little bit, and am now open to possibly working there. We connected on LinkedIn and she pings me periodically to see if I'm looking for a new position. Imagine if you were very early in your career, looking to land your first gig, this could be a great place to gain first-hand knowledge, not only from the recruiters on-site, but from the thousands of people already in the field with varying experiences. Its like a gold mine of data waiting to be picked. Yes, local meetups are great too, but this is on a whole nother level.

### Struggles

No large event is without its struggles, and Render was no exception. Keep in mind, this was post-covid, and can see that the organizers may have had limited options in terms of booking a venue. I mention the venue for a number of reasons. First, it was too small for the amount of attendees, as well as the booths that occupied much of the indoor space. At times, it was difficult to get from one stage to the next because of the congestion and foot traffic. Its also possible that more people attended than was initially expected, but thats just conjecture on my part. Second, it was quite a distance from the hotel, which meant that you couldn't easily return to your room to get away if needed. Third, lines for food were long, and easily took 30+ minutes of standing in one to get your food, but there is a silver lining to this pain point. This meant that you now had extra time to network with the people around you in that same line, which is exactly what I did. And, these were some of the best conversations I had. The last thing that I'll point out, is that some of the speakers either cancelled, or just failed to show up, and it threw the schedule off quite a bit on the first day. This is not the organizer's fault, but everyone was left wondering what was going on, and how it affected the schedule. The only solution I can think of is to have had some backup speakers on standby.

## Render2023

**Do I plan on going, even if I have to pay for it myself?**

### And here's why

Render2023 already has a bigger venue(way bigger). It is even attached to the hotel you will most likely be staying at, which means no long commute in the morning and afternoon. Tons of speakers. The speaker list is 80+ right now, and includes lots of thought leaders in their fields.

**Bigger venue, more speakers, more networking!**

Do you have to go to this conference if you are looking for one to attend? **Absolutely not**, there are lots of conferences held all throughout the year, and some not very far from you. This is just one that I enjoyed, and can say that I plan on going back to.
