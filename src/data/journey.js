  ## My Journey in Tech
  I like to say that "I dabble in code, and sometimes it works". Its in an effort to keep myself grounded, 
  to not be confined or defined by my job title, and because its true. I don't write perfect code, or engineer 
  a solution perfectly on the first pass. I enjoy solving problems and just so happen to use code as the primary 
  medium for doing so. I have been dabbling in code since 2011. I was attending my community college, taking courses that 
  would hopefully go towards a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering. Spoiler Alert: that never happened. I was a 
  mechanical engineering major because I had wanted to solve big problems with big impact. This was before I ever considered 
  talking to computers as a career. That changed when I took an intro to programming course, and ended up hooked on code. Today 
  I am a software engineer / developer / coder / key-pusher or any other name that describes what I do. Depending on the context 
  or mood, I will either use the term developer or engineer throughout this post. Just know that this is not the place where I debate 
  that terminology. It is also worth noting that I am at best a 4x developer, and thats perfectly fine with me. But, long before I wrote 
  my first line of what I consider meaninful code, I wrote some basic unix commands and shell scripts(ok, this may be considered code too) 
  many, many years before.
    
  ## 1998 and 1999
  My first real exposure to technology(and yes, I am aware that's a term spanning many areas) was in high school in 1998. 
  Its sad(for me, not for you) that some of you reading this were not even alive then. Oh how the time has passed. My school 
  wasn't a wealthy school by any means, but I am very thankful to have had a teacher that taught technology related topics 
  from AC/DC electronics to A+ and Network+ certifications. He was a retired Air Force Colonel(or Lt. Colonel) that if I remember
   correctly, and was an engineer of some sort when he served. I know his first name was Dan, but for the life of me cannot 
   remember his last name. Oh, if there was only a way to find that out ;). I ended up taking a couple of the courses that Colonel 
   Dan taught, and because I was able to pick it up so quickly, I was given the opportunity to participate in a school work program 
   over the summers of 1998 and 1999 along with 1 other student where we would visit schools in the district performing software 
   installs, system upgrades(hardware and software), networking, and some light troubleshooting. This is where I first learned how to 
   create jumper cables(ethernet) and format hard drives. Until recently, I used to discredit this as not relevant to software engineering,
    but no longer do so because I have in so many ways leaned on those experiences when solving problems. I was discounting my experiences 
    and abilities, making it easier for potential employers to pay me less or to mark down my skills. Because on paper, it looks like I 
    just started doing this in 2017. Thats a huge difference right. I had to bust out a calculator just to do the math. In fairness, its 
    not like I worked in a tech space from that time onward. You see, I love solving problems, but find it difficult to solve the same problem 
    over and over again. So, as I entered my senior year, I was ready for a new challenge, and decided to join the Army.
    
  ## 2000 - 2009
  This section will be brief. I served in the Army from the summer of 2000 to the summer of 2004. After exiting the military, I returned 
  to my hometown, met my wife, and went on to work jobs as porter at a dealership, cable splicer at a contracting company, and field technician 
  at a local cable company. In what seems like the blink of an eye, nine years came and went.
      
  ## College
  My wife is a nurse today, but she didn't always want to be one. Turns out that she had attended college before I met her, and was 
  on an extended break from what was going to be a pyschology degree. This break lasted many years, and I'm sure longer than she had 
  anticipated. Finally, in 2009, we both decided to go back to school together. We needed to make a change, and were looking for careers, 
  not jobs. I chose mechanical engineering, and she chose nursing. Interestingly enough, and as if he was seeking the perfect timing to make 
  his grand entrance, my son decided to show up at the end of 2009. My wife did not have the ideal pregnancy, with our first or second child, 
  and this made attending college really difficult. Nonetheless, she was able to complete her nursing degree on time, and quickly went to work. 
  At the beginning of this section I said that we both went back to school together. That's 100% true. We did not however, continue together. 
  When my son was born, I went back to work full-time to help support our family, and have struggled to this day to finish what I started. It does not 
  mean that I quit school completely, but that I attended on and off for about 9 years. That's a long time, I know. I should be a doctor by now. 
  Somewhere in there, before taking a break, I took that intro to programming course in C++  as I mentioned earlier that changed everything, including 
  my major.
      
  ## Building Apps
  I am a firm believer in the idea that if you aren't happy with the way things are, you change them. Even though school was ultimately put 
  on hold for me, it didn't mean that I couldn't continue to learn and progress on my own. Sometime in 2014, I got into building iOS apps. I 
  thought about what tech I had available to me, and what I found really interesting. We had my wife's macbook pro she purchased for nursing 
  school, and no longer needed. I had an early version ipad, and an iphone. The decision was simple. I'll build mobile apps for the iOS platform. 
  Another motivating factor were all the Udemy and YouTube tutorials in Swift, which at the time was still fairly new. I think it was version 2 
  when I started working with it, but was very human-readable and appealing. If I had to start with Objective C, it might not had gone so well. 
  Over about 3 years I built and published 4 apps to the AppStore that I was really proud of. Correction, I am still really proud of them. These 
  were fairly original ideas and included custom(and cringy) artwork. I found that I learned more quickly and thoroughly when I had to solve 
  problems that I was interested in solving, and had not already been solved for me. Theres nothing wrong with follow-along tutorials, but I 
  recommend to anyone interested in gaining deep understanding of something to solve problems interesting to them, regardless of the discipline.
      
  ## First Paying Opportunity
  I had known about USAA for a long time. In fact, I had been a member since joining the military in 2000. I regarded them as a company with 
  high moral standards, and one that treated their members well, myself included. In early 2016, I found out about a program they were running 
  called VetFit. It provided veterans the opportunity to go through a tech bootcamp of sorts, while getting paid intern-level compensation, and 
  having a position as an entry-level software developer when it was successfully completed. I applied, made it through some rounds, but was 
  ultimately not chosen for the cohort. It hurt. A lot. At this point, I thought I was the perfect fit, having built 4 amazing(not so much) apps, 
  and having interviewed so well, and whatever else. What did I do wrong? Well, I had no choice but to pick myself up. Had I let that be the end 
  of my journey, I would not be here talking about it. I continued to maintain my apps, and started learning more about frontend development. I 
  was and continue to be passionate about great user experiences whether mobile or on the web. When the next cohort was being filled, I was very 
  hesitant to apply because I did not want to be rejected again. I am so glad that I ignored those feelings, and did apply, because it became my 
  first paying job in software. Something that I forgot to mention, so I'll just drop it here. I had applied to many entry-level iOS developer jobs 
  before landing the one at USAA, but I got nothing in terms of traction. It was like sending applications into a black hole. Stuff goes in, but 
  nothing comes out. If you are in a similar position, remember, the first one is always the hardest to land. After that, it only gets better.
      
  ## Present Day
  Today I work at a startup(sort of) as a Senior Frontend Engineer. The role before this one was also at a startup. Whether you work at a startup or 
  enterprise, or somewhere in between, know what you bring to the table. Be confident, but tactful when discussing your experience and skills and how 
  they can help this or the next company. Don't be so quick to discount your experiences just because they may not feel relevant. Do an inventory of 
  what you've accomplished thus far. I used to think that you and only you were your own advocate and cheerleader. I was wrong. Surround yourself with 
  people that cheer for you and hype you up because they know that the team is better off with you on it, than without.
      
  Everything else, well, thats another story for another day.`,
